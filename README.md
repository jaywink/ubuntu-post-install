Forked from https://github.com/snwh/ubuntu-post-install.

This script has been heavily customized for my personal use, including even some network folder paths inside my own network. It is probably only good for pulling ideas from, not for direct usage on your machine. If you want a more generic version, please check the original version linked above.
